# 4Node Quadrilateral Element FEA

MATLAB codes for performing Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on a 4-node quadrilateral element. Developed by Hamed Valae, M.Sc. of Civil Engineering and Hydraulic Structures.

## Overview

This MATLAB code is designed to analyze the behavior of a 4-node quadrilateral element using the Finite Element Method. The analysis includes the calculation of nodal displacements, support reactions, element stresses, strains, and principal stresses.

## Files

- **Nodes.txt**: Text file containing nodal coordinates.
- **Forces.txt**: Text file containing applied forces.
- **Elements.txt**: Text file specifying element connectivity.
- **Constraints.txt**: Text file specifying constrained nodes and directions.

## Usage

1. Place the input data files (`Nodes.txt`, `Forces.txt`, `Elements.txt`, `Constraints.txt`) in the same directory as the MATLAB script.
2. Run the MATLAB script.
3. Enter the required input parameters such as Modulus of Elasticity, Poissonâ€™s ratio, and Thickness when prompted.
4. View the analysis results, including nodal displacements, support reactions, element stresses, strains, and principal stresses.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input files are correctly formatted according to the provided examples.
- Modify the input files to suit your specific problem and geometry.
